## Prerequisites

   - **PyTorch 1.10 - 1.13**: Requires Python `>=3.7, <3.10`
   - **PyTorch 2.x**: Requires Python `>=3.10`

   ### To Check Your Python Version:
   ```bash
   python --version

Conda: Ensure that Anaconda or Miniconda is installed.

Installation Steps
Step 1: Create a Conda Environment with a Compatible Python Version
If your current Python version doesn’t match the required version, create a new environment with the correct Python version.
Replace X.Y with the compatible Python version for your desired PyTorch version:
bash
Copy code
conda create -n maintenance_assistant python=X.Y
conda activate maintenance_assistant

Step 2: Install PyTorch
Install PyTorch based on your system specifications. For a CPU-only installation, use the following command. Replace the version (2.0.1 in this example) if needed.
bash
Copy code
# For CPU-only installation:
conda install pytorch=2.0.1 cpuonly -c pytorch

If you need a specific CUDA version for GPU support, refer to the PyTorch installation guide and adjust accordingly.
Step 3: Install Transformers
After PyTorch is set up, install the Transformers library from Hugging Face.
bash
Copy code
pip install transformers

Step 4: Install Additional Dependencies
If your project has additional dependencies, you can install them using pip or conda. For example:
bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas flask

Verifying Installation
Run the following Python code to check that both PyTorch and Transformers were installed correctly:
python
Copy code
import torch
import transformers

print(f"PyTorch version: {torch.__version__}")
print(f"Transformers version: {transformers.__version__}")


Usage
After installation, you can start using the Generative AI-Powered Maintenance Support Assistant by executing the main script. Adjust the configuration as needed:
bash
Copy code
python main.py

Example Commands
Ask the assistant for troubleshooting tips.
Request predictive maintenance advice.
Get real-time updates on maintenance schedules.

Troubleshooting
LibMamba Unsatisfiable Errors: Ensure all dependencies are satisfied and that you’re using a compatible Python version.
Conflicting Python Version: If errors persist, try creating a new conda environment with a specific Python version as described above.
